-- goals and general functionality

The goal of this system is to help a delivery company manage orders by utilizing an SQL database.
The system has the ability to add, update and delete clients, dispatchers, orders etc. as well as to display data via numerous queries.

-- work process and problems encountered

In the two weeks our team worked on this project work was overall going smoothly, outside of a few hiccups including git and some members not being as familliar with it as others which led to some minor slowdowns.
Even so when issues were resolved all members were able to work simultaniously utilizing git's magic.
One other issue was the lack of internet on one occasion which led to members not being able to share work done and generally inconvenienced the team.

In terms of the order of the tasks done, first of all the team established the structure of the SQL database. Afterwards idk we'll finish this shit later
